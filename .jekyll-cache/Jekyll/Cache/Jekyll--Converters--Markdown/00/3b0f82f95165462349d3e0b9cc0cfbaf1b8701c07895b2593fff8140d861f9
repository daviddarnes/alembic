<p>Problems:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Hard to know the path way of transformation stretch tensor, it is very hard to measure;</li>
  <li>Bain strain maybe is not the most suitable transformation stretch tensor;</li>
  <li>Initial and final crystal structure do not have group/sub-group relation.</li>
</ol>

<p>This Algorithm solve:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Find the most suitable unit cell(maybe is no unit cell) to construte the transformation tensor;</li>
  <li>Can calculate the tensor even though with no group/sub-group relation;</li>
  <li>Predict not reversible transformation tensor.</li>
</ol>
