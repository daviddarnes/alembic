<ol>
  <li>Nothing is more important than a mathematical model: know the basic physic meaning and make some assumptions, build up model, use simulation to clarify, find some phenomena and make commons.</li>
  <li>This model is based on mechanical strain, stress;</li>
  <li>The boundary situation really depends on the orientation(mis-orientation between grains), but not the direction of loading.</li>
</ol>
