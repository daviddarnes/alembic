<ol>
  <li>Non-classical interface can be analyzed by classical compatible theory, rank-one connection;</li>
  <li>Analyze the relationship between the twins fraction and the orientation fraction;</li>
  <li>Using the cofactor condition to study it;</li>
  <li>It could be a good guide book for somebody who want to analyze the interface and calculate the related matrix.Also, it can provide some views to analyze the twins and phase transformation too.</li>
  <li>Drawback: this theory can only be used on very special condition, and the observation is hard to find.</li>
