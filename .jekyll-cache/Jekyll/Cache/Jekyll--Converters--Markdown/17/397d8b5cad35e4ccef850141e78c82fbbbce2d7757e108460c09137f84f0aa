<p>The purpose of this paper is to derive additional results of the theory which are not associated with the austenite/martensite interface or the crystallographic theory of martensite and which are amenable to simple quantitative experimental tests.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Ignore any contribution to the energy associated with interfaces between phases and the gravitational potential energy, then hypothesis that at a fixed temperature, there is a energy well for the material to drop in, each energy well is a phase. The energy here is just for one phase energy, not the total energy of the material;</li>
  <li>When the twin is finer and finer, the layer will approach the bottom of the energy well, and here, we get the minima of the austenite/martensite interface, but it ignore the interfacial energy of martensite/martensite interface, that is also a reason for the twin is impossible perfect for the interface of austenite/martensite;</li>
  <li>At that time, the morphology of material have been studied by Khachaturyan, they also seek rank-one connection and multiple layers for energy reduction. Although this paper gives the formula of the linear strain equation and the energy function based on the linear theory(KRS theory), the KRS theory is still nonlinear;</li>
  <li>Not including the large shears associated with plasticity, for theory point of view, it will increase the accuracy, for experiment point of view, large shear will cause the dislocations and the material will become plasity;</li>
  <li>Rank-one connection: $RU_2-U_1 = \vec{a} \otimes \vec{n}$. Each rank-one connection corresponds to a possible interface. The problem to find a rank-one connection is equivalent to finding solutions of $m, b$ of $C = (1+m \otimes b)(1+b \otimes m)$, which is given in the <a href="http://joephysworld.com/2017/04/17/fine_phase_mixtures/">1987‚Äôs paper</a>;</li>
  <li>Include the Cauchy-Born rule, to transfer the atom‚Äôs movement into the continuum theory and use the continuum theory to study the phase transformation, and use the lattice parameter to describe the free energy of the system;</li>
  <li>It also points out the the rank-one connection‚Äôs middle eigenvalue equals to 1 is a very rarely case;</li>
  <li>The one-well problem is that when the laminate layers(just one phase) go to infinite, whether the free energy of the transformation layer can approach to 0, but it had been proved that no microstructure can occur in the one-well problem;</li>
  <li>If the boundary condition is very strict, the three well problems have no solution for the energy minimization, and the three well problem will return to the two well problem. But if we change the boundary condition to a weaker one, the three well problem could have a solution;</li>
  <li>Beside the little interface energy will restrict the number of the fine layer, James also propose there is a viscoelastic(dissipation energy) to stop the fine layer, but the reason is unclear. Also, the defects and local variations of composition may play a role in some cases.</li>
