<p>Martensite has a long history, because it is discovered by Martens by microscope, so the material which owns a special structure is called martensite. Martensite has been widely used in super-elastic materials and shape memory alloys. This article is just for briefly introducing the relevant concepts of martensite phase transformation.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-phase">What is phase?</h2>
<p>Firstly, it is very important to clear what is phase. Phase is a special type for the materials to exist in nature. What we are familiar with is air phase, liquid phase and solid phase.</p>

<p>But actually, there are many types of structure in solid. In atom’s point of view, because different kinds of atom owns different kinds of diameter, and as we know that the atoms are closely stack in the solid phase, so different composition of material will have different way to stack. Imagine that use just one kind of ball to stack them in order, that is just like what atoms are doing. There are many kinds of structure for atoms to stack, such as cubic, tetragonal, monoclinic and etc. The crystallography is a subject that study the structure of the solid materials and if you are interested in it you can learn a lot in this subject. So for different structure, it means different phase, a structure is a phase, that is what the phase means in material science.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-phase-transformation">What is phase transformation?</h2>
<p>Here, we know that the concepts of the phase, but how one phase transfer to another phase? It equals to how one structure transfer to another structure? The most popular concept of phase transformation is the ice transfer into water, it means that the ice is undergoing the phase transformation from solid phase to the liquid phase.</p>

<p>The atoms is closely packing in order in solid phase but they will be in chaos in air phase. In solid, it is the same but a little different. If the atom is stacking as cubic in original, and because of the environment change (heat, force, strain or whatever), it becomes tetragonal in final state. We call it is the phase transformation. But why the atom will arrange itself to change its stack? The simple answer will like this:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Imagine that you have eight balls to form a cubic stack, and they have springs between them. And now you add a tension on one of the face, the structure will transfer into tetragonal. This is the phase transformation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So in a particular temperature, strain and stress, every material owns its the most comfortable way to pack and make sure that the energy of the material is the least at this particular condition. It means that the material will be stable in a particular temperature or stress or strain. So that is why when we change the temperature or stress, the material will change its way to pack, and it is the phase transformation.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-martensite-phase-transformation">What is martensite phase transformation?</h2>
<p>Actually, martensite and austenite is not a special structure, it is just a name for describing the phase transformation. Before the phase transformation, the structure(whatever crystallography structure) is austenite, and after the phase transformation, the structure is martensite. Usually, the martensite phase is the phase that can be stable in low temperature and austenite is stable in high temperature. What’s more, martensite phase usually owns less symmetry operations, and austenite phase owns more symmetry operations. It means that the point group of austenite is bigger than martensite. Based on this, many researcher assume that the point group of martensite is a sub-group of austenite. And because of this, after the phase transformation, the entropy will increase, so the material will release heat to the environment, inversely, the material will gain heat from the environment. It is just for the usual cases, not for all the martensite phase transformation cases.</p>

<p>Here, we know the basic concepts of martensite phase transformation. We majority use crystallography, X-Ray diffraction, continuum mechanics and thermodynamics to study the phase transformation. Hope this can be a good article for you to know the martensite phase transformation.</p>
