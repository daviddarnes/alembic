<ol>
  <li>Compatible condition is a strong condition, more than linear minimizer and finer and finer microstructure;</li>
  <li>There are 2 kinds of phase transformations, one is precipitation, this one is a diffusional one, and another one is martensite;</li>
  <li>If the inter face is not perfect, many defects inclusions and eigenstrain will occur;</li>
  <li>$\lambda_2$ only depends on lattice parameters;</li>
  <li>Find transformation matrix: find a basic, which is the most closer basic to Martensite unit cell, then calculate the most small distortion and use this as a transformation matrix;</li>
  <li>Five ways to form the microstructure, different types of twins have different cofactor conditions;</li>
  <li>Geometry linear theory can be used to analyze the microstructure.</li>
</ol>
