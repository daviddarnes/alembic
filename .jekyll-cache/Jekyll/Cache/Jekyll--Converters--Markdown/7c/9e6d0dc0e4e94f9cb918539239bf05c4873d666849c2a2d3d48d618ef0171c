<ol>
  <li>Geometry non-linear theory predicts reversibility material or phase transition;</li>
  <li>Clear relationship between hysteresis and the middle eigenvalue of transformation stretch tensor;</li>
  <li>The hysteresis can be drastically minimized by improving the compatibility;</li>
  <li>Austenite is directly compatible with a single variant of Martensite;</li>
  <li>Elastic energy and interfacial energy is competing with each other, and they will become the majority reason for hysteresis heat;</li>
  <li>Hysteresis related to $\lambda_2$, but not obviously relates to det(U).</li>
</ol>
