<ol>
  <li>KS theory (Khachaturyan and Shatalov) developed a reciprocal-space formulation of the strain energy as an explicit functional of arbitrary continuous distributions of structural non-uniformities.</li>
  <li>The microstructures developed in a MT can be characterized by a set of non-conserved fields, the structural order parameter (SOP) fields. The SOP fields distinguishing the martensite and austenite phases is the tetragonal Bain distortion (transformation matrix). Also the SOP is the amplitude of a ‚Äúsoft‚Äù optical displacement mode that results in a mutual displacement of atoms within a unit cell of the parent phase (shuffle). And we can use SOP as the order parameter to describe the chemical energy and elastic energy.</li>
  <li>To construe the Landau free energy function, there are several constants should be determined, it this paper, they are expansion coefficients. They can be determined by fitting the Landau free energy to thermodynamic databases or first principles calculations.</li>
  <li>In the Allen-Cahn equation (non-conserved order parameter), it considers the Langevin random force term. It gives some disturbs to the system to simulate the effect of the thermodynamics.</li>
  <li>This paper likes a review of the SOP phase field method. It introduce the concepts of SOP and also gives some useful articles to introduce Langevin term, and introduce another SOP order parameter to describe the crack and nucleation.</li>
