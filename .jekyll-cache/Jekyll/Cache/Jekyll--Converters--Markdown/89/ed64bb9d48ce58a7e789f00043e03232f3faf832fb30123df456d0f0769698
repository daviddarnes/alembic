<p>The second part of the model, it describes how the model build up in details and present some examples and results in the article.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Taking into account size effects due to the interfacial energy and also dissipation related to annihilation of interfaces. In the article, it majority use the austenite and two variants of martensite to construct the micro-structure.</li>
  <li>Limitation: first, focus on the pseudoelastic behaviour of shape memory alloys; second, isothermal quasi-static transformations only and assume the dissipation is fully rate-independent; geometric nonlinearity is neglected and homogeneity and isotropy are assumed.</li>
  <li>Determining the energy of a transition layer at a planar boundary of laminated domains and express it by an analytic formula with a single adjustable parameter. The morphology of the interfacial layer was determined by energy minimization with respect to free shape parameters.</li>
  <li>The volume fraction may depend on the interfacial energy components and hence be different for interfaces on different scales.</li>
  <li>Using periodic displacement field to deform the material.</li>
  <li>Considering the incompatible phase will generate the elastic energy in the interface and the bulk energy.</li>
  <li>The total energy includes: bulk free energy (bulk energy terms and interfacial energy terms, also the interfacial energy terms includes the atomic scale energy and the effect of grain boundaries) and dissipation energy. To solve the problem, it uses incremental energy minimization rule, to make the increment of the energy is the minimization.</li>
  <li>For the initial stage, microstructure can be determined simply by minimizing the interfacial energy.</li>
  <li>Because it consider the interfacial energy, so it can study the size effect during the evolution.</li>
</ol>

<p>In conclusion, the theory consider the free energy function and dissipation function, then using the energy increment minimization to get the microstructure. Because it considers the interfacial energy in three different scales, M-M, A-M and grain boundary, so it builds up the interfacial energy in there different scales. It is a sharp interface theory, a little different from the classical phase-field modeling. In the micro-structureâ€™s point of view, we can study and observe the microstructure by this model; but in macrostructureâ€™s point of view, although it can predict the volume fraction, it cannot give the real picture of the macrostructure of material, because the position of the interface has been already determined before the simulation.</p>
