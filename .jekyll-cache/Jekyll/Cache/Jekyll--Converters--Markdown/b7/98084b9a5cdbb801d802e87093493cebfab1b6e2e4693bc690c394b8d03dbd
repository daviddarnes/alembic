<ol>
  <li>This article likes a library of the types of cubic to monoclinic phase transition and the twin types;</li>
  <li>Generic type twin is less that non-generic type;</li>
  <li>When we want to describe a phoneme, we should find whether there is a support from other paper;</li>
  <li>Introduction can be a content;</li>
  <li>Conventional twins have 5 properties;</li>
  <li>Rank-one connection is: $det(U-V) = 0$ and the eigenvalue of $U$ and $V$ is equal, the rank-one connection is saying that there is an undistorted plane;</li>
  <li>Non-generic twins must satisfy the symmetry and the spectacular equation.</li>
</ol>
