<ol>
  <li>Propose a question. There are two possible structures of Cu-Au-Zn alloy. But one of them is more stable;</li>
  <li>Using the technic of energy dispersive X-Ray;</li>
  <li>Using XRD, includes structure factor, Lorenz factor, temperature factor and multiplicity;</li>
  <li>Transformation stress is smaller;</li>
  <li>Find a critical point to distinguish [111] and [019];</li>
  <li>Describe the order and disorder magnitude;</li>
  <li>Disorder is responsible for stabilization of Martensite;</li>
  <li>Different aging has different results(configurations), and it is responsible for stability.</li>
</ol>
