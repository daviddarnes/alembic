<p>Use both nonlinear theory and crystallography theory to calculate the martensite phase transition problem.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Two paths to transformation: shear of a rectangular face of tetragonal, shear of square base of tetragonal;</li>
  <li>It is a library of tetragonal to monoclinic for Zirconia;</li>
  <li>First use compatibility to test the variants, and then use crystallographic theory to get habit plane and volume fraction. The habit plane depends on the twin fraction;</li>
  <li>It separate the cases into i, ii, iii. Seems that they relates to type I, type II and compound;</li>
  <li>The habit plane is fixed and twin fraction fixed. But now, the habit plane is infinity.</li>
  <li>Crystallography theory: The lattice invariant shear or twins are input data for the crystallographic theory, and in practice, one assumes a twin based on experiments (Wayman, 1964). Consequently the crystallographic theory can predict all the possible habit planes for a martensitic transformation only if all the possible twins between the martensite variants are known.</li>
