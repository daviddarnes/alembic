<p>Shape memory alloy thin films in optical devices is introduced and explored for the firs time. Here it uses NiTi as the shape memory alloy to build up thermo-induced phase transition experiments. Reflection coefficient of NiTi were measured under room temperature in the Martensitic and Austenitic phase. The reflection coefficient is higher in Austenite than the Martensite.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Shape memory alloy can deformed as a Martensite below transition temperature, and deform back after heating up.</li>
  <li>Martensite and Austenite differ in microstructures, Young modulus, thermal expansion coefficient and electrical conductivity.</li>
  <li>When TiNi undergo phase transformation(heat up), they become more reflecting and ‘shiny’.</li>
  <li>TiNi undergoes the phase transformation, the roughness changes so the light scattering and its refractive index change too.</li>
  <li>Can be used on the optical thermal and mechanical properties of NiTi. Using NiTi as a switch, when the temperature reaches a critical temperature, the NiTi will undergoes phase transition and the reflective coefficient will change. So we can use this kind of change as a switch to open or close something. But the thermal designs should be quite fast.</li>
</ol>

<p>The reflection coefficient of TiNi change as a function of phase transformation and wavelength. Not focus on the interface of phase transformation.</p>
