Hi, I am _@huxpro_ (Huang, Xuan), an UI/Frontend engineer & designer, accidentally growing into a compiler hacker. My current interests range from programming languages theory and implementation in general (compiler, type system, type-based formal verification, virtual machine, runtime systems, garbage collection) to software engineering in the tech industry (client-side web/mobile app development, server-side backend, user interface and UX, developer infrastructure and DX). 

I'm currently working on the [Hermes JavaScript Engine](https://hermesengine.dev/) at [Facebook](http://facebook.com/). I was also involved in some of the [Facebook Reality Labs](https://tech.fb.com/ar-vr/) and the [ReasonML](https://reasonml.github.io/) (now [ReScript](https://rescript-lang.org/)) efforts. I'm also passionated about [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/). 

In the past, I worked on [Alitrip (Fliggy)](https://www.alitrip.com/) mobile and web apps under the [Alibaba Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alibaba_Group), found and lead front-end infrastructure team at an unicorn startup company [Beijing Weiying (a.k.a. WePiao, now acquired by Maoyan)](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/beijing-weiying-technology), and helped [Ele.me (now acquired by Alibaba)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ele.me) to upgrade their mobile web site into [the first influential PWA (progressive web app) in China](https://medium.com/elemefe/upgrading-ele-me-to-progressive-web-app-2a446832e509).

I studied BA, Digital Media Art at [Communication University of China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_University_of_China) and MS, Computer Science (with a focus on programming languages) at [Rochester Institute of Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rochester_Institute_of_Technology).

##### [My PL Spectrum (WIP 🚧)](https://huangxuan.me/2020/05/05/pl-chart/)

I made a chart to visualize my experiences and interests on some of the programming languages. I know. I know this is always contraversial. But it's just something quite self-entertaining to do. So bare with me and have fun reading that!
