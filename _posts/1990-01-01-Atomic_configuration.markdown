Two possible structures of Cu-Au-Zn and technics
-----------
Propose a question. There are two possible structures of Cu-Au-Zn alloy, but one of them is more stable and the energy is lower than the other one.

1. Using the technic of Energy Dispersive X-Ray;
2. Using XRD, including structure factor, Lorenz factor, temperature factor and multiplicity;
3. Transformation stress is smaller in one of the structures of Cu-Au-Zn alloy;
4. Find a critical point to disdinguish [111] and [019];
5. Order and disorder magnitude;
6. Disorder is responsible for stabilization of Martensite;
7. Different aging has different results (configurations), and it is responsible for the order-disorder and the stability.
