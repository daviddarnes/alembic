Review several important conceptions of Martensite phase transition
-----------

1. Point group of Martensite is a subgroup of Austenite;
2. Free energy function is a function of lattice and temperature;
3. Number of variants is relevant to the point group;
4. Compatible is important especially for interface;
5. Interface involve the material does not the energy minima;
6. X ray pictures did not give deromation;
7. In wedge, Martensite regions are single variantes.
