Technics and configurations of Cu-Au-Zu
-----------

1. Propose a question. There are two possible structures of Cu-Au-Zn alloy. But one of them is more stable;
2. Using the technic of energy dispersive X-Ray;
3. Using XRD, includes structure factor, Lorenz factor, temperature factor and multiplicity;
4. Transformation stress is smaller;
5. Find a critical point to distinguish [111] and [019];
6. Describe the order and disorder magnitude;
7. Disorder is responsible for stabilization of Martensite;
8. Different aging has different results(configurations), and it is responsible for stability.
