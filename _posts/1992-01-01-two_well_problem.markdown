Nonlinear geometry and two-well problem
-----------
The purpose of this paper is to derive additional results of the theory which are not associated with the austenite/martensite interface or the crystallographic theory of martensite and which are amenable to simple quantitative experimental tests.

1. Ignore any contribution to the energy associated with interfaces between phases and the gravitational potential energy, then hypothesis that at a fixed temperature, there is a energy well for the material to drop in, each energy well is a phase. The energy here is just for one phase energy, not the total energy of the material;
2. When the twin is finer and finer, the layer will approach the bottom of the energy well, and here, we get the minima of the austenite/martensite interface, but it ignore the interfacial energy of martensite/martensite interface, that is also a reason for the twin is impossible perfect for the interface of austenite/martensite;
3. At that time, the morphology of material have been studied by Khachaturyan, they also seek rank-one connection and multiple layers for energy reduction. Although this paper gives the formula of the linear strain equation and the energy function based on the linear theory(KRS theory), the KRS theory is still nonlinear;
4. Not including the large shears associated with plasticity, for theory point of view, it will increase the accuracy, for experiment point of view, large shear will cause the dislocations and the material will become plasity;
5. Rank-one connection: $RU_2-U_1 = \vec{a} \otimes \vec{n}$. The problem to find a rank-one connection is equivalent to finding solutions of $m, b$ of $C = (1+m \otimes b)(1+b \otimes m)$, which is given in the [1987's paper](http://joephysworld.com/2017/04/17/fine_phase_mixtures/);
6. Include the Cauchy-Born rule, to transfer the atom's movement into the continuum theory and use the continuum theory to study the phase transformation, and use the lattice parameter to describe the free energy of the system;
7.
