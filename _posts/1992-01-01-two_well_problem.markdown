Nonlinear geometry and two-well problem
-----------
This paper is a new model to describe the phase transformation. The key thing is converge energy and compatibility.

1. Not associated Austenite/Martensite interface;
2. Ignore interfacial energy, because it proposes that the microstructure will be fine enough to minimize the interfacial energy;
3. No volume change, and rank-one connection for and only for two energy wells;
4. Austenite to Martensite transformation is elasticity, avoiding large shear energy, and the point group of Martensite is a part of point group of Austenite;
5. Rank-one connection: $RU_2-U_1 = \vec{a} \otimes \vec{n}$
