Microstructure size
-----------

1. Recoverable strain not only depends on texture of poly-crystal and transformation strain, but also critically depends on change of symmetry;
2. Grain is not free to deform, it is constrained by the deformation of neighboring grains;
3. Poly-crystal cannot deform without damage;
4. Habit plane depends on volume fraction;
5. Poly-crystal with sufficient symmetry have no recoverable strain;
6. Best shape-memory effect, try to make monoclinic Martensite;
7. Factor for failure: elastic anisotropy, stress, temperature and grain size.
