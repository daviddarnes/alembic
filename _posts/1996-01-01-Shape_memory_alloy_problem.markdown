Some materials have good shape-memory behavior as single crystals but little or none as polycrystals, while others can also present the good shape-memory behavior both in single crystal and polycrystal. This paper points out that the recoverable strain depends on the texture of the polycrystal, the transformation strain of the underlying martensitic transformation and especially critically on the change of symmetry during the underlying transformation. The greater change in symmetry, the greater recoverable strain.

1. Recoverable strain not only depends on texture of poly-crystal and transformation strain, but also critically depends on change of symmetry;
2. Using a geometrically linear theory and consider infinitesimal strains;
3. Variants here means the “lattice correspondence variants” which are associated with changes in crystal structure, not the 24 “habit-plane variants” or “plate variants”. The later one is generated from crystallography theory and considers internally twined martensite with fixed volume fraction, but here this paper uses detwinning which is not allowed in the crystallography theory;
4. If the variants are compatible with each other, it use the linear formula to present the deformation gradient of the material, but if the variants are not compatible with each other, it use the average deformation gradient to describe;
5. Assume twin scale is much smaller than the typical grain size;
6. Grain is not free to deform, it is constrained by the deformation of neighboring grains;
7. Poly-crystal's deformation often will induce the damage because of the stress concentration;
8. Habit plane depends on volume fraction;
9. Poly-crystal with sufficient symmetry have no recoverable strain;
10. Best shape-memory effect, try to make monoclinic Martensite;
11. Factor for failure: elastic anisotropy, stress, temperature and grain size.
