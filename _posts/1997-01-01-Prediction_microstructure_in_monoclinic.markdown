It is after the nonlinear geometry just a few years, I think this is a kind of application, use a new theory to explain a material's phase transition.
-----------

1. It still use layer to estimate the phase transformation. I think in Sherry's paper, she reduce the layer and make material perfectly compatible;
2. Although theory is beautiful, but it cannot reduce the transition layer, so the biggest drawback of this article is it cannot explain the equation of the transition layer;
3. Maybe is this article, improves the fine and fine microstructure to reduce the transformation layer;
4. It teaches us how to calculate the $U, R$ and $n, a$ and other things.
