Library of tetragonal to monoclinic
-----------
Use both nonlinear theory and crystallography theory to calculate the martensite phase transition problem.


1. Two paths to transformation: shear of a rectangular face of tetragonal, shear of square base of tetragonal;
2. It is a library of tetragonal to monoclinic for Zirconia;
3. First use compatibility to test the variants, and then use crystallographic theory to get habit plane and volume fraction. The habit plane depends on the twin fraction;
4. It separate the cases into i, ii, iii. Seems that they relates to type I, type II and compound;
5. The habit plane is fixed and twin fraction fixed. But now, the habit plane is infinity.
6. Crystallography theory: The lattice invariant shear or twins are input data for the crystallographic theory, and in practice, one assumes a twin based on experiments (Wayman, 1964). Consequently the crystallographic theory can predict all the possible habit planes for a martensitic transformation only if all the possible twins between the martensite variants are known.
