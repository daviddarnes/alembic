Library of tetragonal to monoclinic
-----------

1. Two paths to transformation: shear of a rectangular face of tetragonal, shear of square base of tetragonal;
2. It is a library of tetragonal to monoclinic for Zirconia;
3. First use compatibility to test the variants, and then use crystallographic theory to get habit plane and fraction. The habit plane depends on the twin fraction;
4. It separate the cases into i, ii, iii. Seems that they relates to type I, type II and compound;
5. Maybe the majority difference between Sherry and other is the possibility of the habit plane? The habit plane is fixed and twin fraction fixed. But now, the habit plane is infinity.
