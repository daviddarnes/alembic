Cubic to Monoclinic phase transition
-----------

1. This article likes a library of the types of cubic to monoclinic phase transition and the twin types;
2. Generic type twin is less that non-generic type;
3. When we want to describe a phoneme, we should find whether there is a support from other paper;
4. Introduction can be a content;
5. Conventional twins have 5 properties;
6. Rank-one connection is: $det(U-V) = 0$ and the eigenvalue of $U$ and $V$ is equal, the rank-one connection is saying that there is an undistorted plane;
7. Non-generic twins must satisfy the symmetry and the spectacular equation.
