Conclusion paper
-----------

1. Nucleation and growth of microstructure during a thermoelastic martensitic transformation, then give the complex result and an example;
2. Compatibility equation have solution related the symmetry;
3. C-B rule assumes lattice vector behave as material line under deformation;
4. Rank-one connection: undistorted plane
5. Rank-two connection: normal of undistorted plane unchanged (weaker condition, persipitation);
6. Compound twin is just one solution, Type I and II two solutions;
7. Just assume that the transition layer has a width of $\frac{1}{k}$;
8. Cubic to Tetragonal, discuss the wedge, diamond, triangle, twin.
