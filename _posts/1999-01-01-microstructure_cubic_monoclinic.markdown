Ni-Ti microstructure
-----------

1. This paper is for discussing the possible for Ni-Ti to form a microstructure, Type I twin, Type II twin and compound;
2. Almost all the possible depend on the lattice parameter of Ni-Ti has been discussed;
3. It can be used as catalog of Ni-Ti, microstructure to check whether a microstructure is possible for a specific composition;
4. We should know the coordinate correspondence first, then we can transfer the coordination, then calculate the transformation matrix. The procedure is the same in Sherry's paper.
5. All the paper is based on the James 1987 and 1992. It's the milestone of Martensite phase transformation.
