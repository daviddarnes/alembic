First use microscope to observe the thin film
-----------

Shape memory alloy thin films in optical devices is introduced and explored for the firs time. Here it uses NiTi as the shape memory alloy to build up thermo-induced phase transition experiments. Reflection coefficient of NiTi were measured under room temperature in the Martensitic and Austenitic phase. The reflection coefficient is higher in Austenite than the Martensite. 

1. Shape memory alloy can deformed as a Martensite below transition temperature, and deform back after heating up.
2. Martensite and Austenite differ in microstructures, Young modulus, thermal expansion coefficient and electrical conductivity.
3. When TiNi undergo phase transformation(heat up), they become more reflecting and 'shiny'.
4. TiNi undergoes the phase transformation, the roughness changes so the light scattering and its refractive index change too.
5. Can be used on the optical thermal and mechanical properties of NiTi. Using NiTi as a switch, when the temperature reaches a critical temperature, the NiTi will undergoes phase transition and the reflective coefficient will change. So we can use this kind of change as a switch to open or close something. But the thermal designs should be quite fast.

The reflection coefficient of TiNi change as a function of phase transformation and wavelength. Not focus on the interface of phase transformation.
