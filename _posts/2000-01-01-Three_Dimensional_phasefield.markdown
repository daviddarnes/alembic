Introduce a model
-----------

Assumptions:

1. Improper Martensite phase transition;
2. in non-homogeneous system (eigenstrain);
3. Applied stress.

Order parameter: optical displacement modes.
External field: strain.

Include: energy of strain, use homogeneous and non homogenous strain and the equilibrium to solve the equations; gradient energy (interfacial energy); chemical energy. It use the kinetic equation and Fourier transformation to solve the equations.
