Review paper, several important conceptions of Martensite phase transition
-----------

1. Point group of Martensite is a sub group of Austenite;
2. Free energy function is a function of lattice and temperature;
3. number of variants is relevant to the point group number;
4. Compatible is important, especially for interface;
5. Interface involve the material does not the energy minima;
6. X ray picture did not give deformation;
7. In wedge, Martensite regions are single variants;
8. As the twin get finer, the inter face is compatible and strain will disappear.
