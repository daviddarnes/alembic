Martensite phase transition
-----------

1. Good fitting of phases will decrease the strain energy and interface energy;
2. First-order phase transformation will generate a change of lattice parameters;
3. If the phase transformation is highly reversible, it is a diffusionless phase transition;
4. Property of material is sensitivity to changes of lattice parameters;
5. det(U) = 1 means no volume change. $\lambda_2 = 1$ will avoid the interfacial energy;
6. According to 3 conditions, we can find material more easily;
7. If satisfy cofactor condition, fraction can change freely and still compatible.
