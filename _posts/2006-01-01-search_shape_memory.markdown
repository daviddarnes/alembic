Important Colusion
-----------

1. Geometry non-linear theory predicts reversibility material or phase transition;
2. Clear relationship between hysteresis and the middle eigenvalue of transformation stretch tensor;
3. The hysteresis can be drastically minimized by improving the compatibility;
4. Austenite is directly compatible with a single variant of Martensite;
5. Elastic energy and interfacial energy is competing with each other, and they will become the majority reason for hysteresis heat;
6. Hysteresis related to $\lambda_2$, but not obviously relates to det(U).
