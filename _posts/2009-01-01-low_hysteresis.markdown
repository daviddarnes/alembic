Hysteresis loop
-----------

1. $\lambda_2$ approaches to 1, the hysteresis will drop sharply.
2. If $\lambda_2$ is not equals to 1, Martensite will shear to accommodate a habit plane with Austenite;
3. If $\lambda_2$ is equal to 1, no lattice invariant shear is required for an undistorted plane to exist;
4. As $\lambda_2$ approaches to 1, microstructure evolves from a lamellar morphology of twin to a twin-less plates.
