Use compatible theory to study
-----------

1. Non-classical interface can be analyzed by classical compatible theory, rank-one connection;
2. Analyze the relationship between the twins fraction and the orientation fraction;
3. Using the cofactor condition to study it;
4. It could be a good guide book for somebody who want to analyze the interface and calculate the related matrix.Also, it can provide some views to analyze the twins and phase transformation too.
5. Drawback: this theory can only be used on very special condition, and the observation is hard to find.
