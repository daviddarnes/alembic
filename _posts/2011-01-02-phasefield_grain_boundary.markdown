Mathematical model
-----------

1. Nothing is more important than a mathematical model: know the basic physic meaning and make some assumptions, build up model, use simulation to clarify, find some phenomena and make commons.
2. This model is based on mechanical strain, stress;
3. The boundary situation really depends on the orientation(mis-orientation between grains), but not the direction of loading.
