Majority study material
-----------

1. Fraction $f$ in the range of [0, 1] of twins can compatible for Austenite;
2. Cofactor condition imply transition layer can be eliminated altogether, not just reduce it;
3. elastic energy can be eliminated at all length scale, the only remaining energy is interfacial energy;
4. 4solutions for the compatible equation, stand for 4 perfect interface;

This paper says that: why cofactor condition stand for perfect compatible, then, eliminate transition layer for type I twin, type II twin and compound twin, then in concludes the different domain system and the nucleation.
