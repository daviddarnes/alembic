Thesis
-----------

1. Compatible condition is a strong condition, more than linear minimizer and finer and finer microstructure;
2. There are 2 kinds of phase transformations, one is precipitation, this one is a diffusional one, and another one is Martensite;
3. If the inter face is not perfect, many defects inclusions and eigenstrain will occur;
4. $\lambda_2$ only depends on lattice parameters;
5. Find transformation matrix is: find a basic, which is the most closer basic to Martensite unit cell, then calculate the most small distortion and use this as a transformation matrix;
6. Five ways to form the microstructure, different types of twins have different cofactor conditions;
7. Geometry linear theory can be used to analyze the microstructure.
