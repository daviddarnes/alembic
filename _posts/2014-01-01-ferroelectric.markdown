Introduce a model
-----------

Assumptions:

1. Stress-strain equilibrium;
2. substract;
3. combine the ferroelectric and stress.

Order parameter: polarization and stress(function of P).

Include: gradient of polarization; energy of polarization; elastic energy.

Crucial point is to solve stress equilibrium and then use L-G to solve. It also describes the substrate deformation domain conditions of the experiment.
