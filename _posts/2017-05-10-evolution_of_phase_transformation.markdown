Introduction of phase transition
-----------

1. If us is a minimizer of the total energy that satisfies the given displacement boundary conditions and has a single phase boundary, then the following must hold: the associated stress must be uniform in the bar, so that mechanical equilibrium prevails; the associated static driving force acting on the phase boundary must vanish so that phase equilibrium prevails. It means that the stress is uniform in the material.
