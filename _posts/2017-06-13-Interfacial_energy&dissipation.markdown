Mathematical model
-----------
Using the volume fraction to describe the free energy function.

1. Incorporating the interfacial energy and dissipation on three different scales and time scales, but here it is just mention about it, in the theory, it majority use the second time scale.
2. Requires a separates symmetry restriction imposed on the state derivative of the dissipation function.
3. A general evolution rule is needed that would provide a criterion of choice. The classical approach is to minimize the total free energy which is path-independent and regarded as a functional of the deformation field and temperature. But most of it does not take into account the dissipation of free energy that invariably accompanies the transition from one equilibrium state to another. Here, it combines the free energy function and the dissipation function.
4. This article use another way to develop the evolution of phase transition. The classical phase-field model is to build up the local energy equation, and the use the variation to solve the equation and get the situation of every point in the material. It is randomly and require a high performance computer. But here, it use the sharpe interface method. It just calculate the total energy of the material, and set the interface's position before the phase transition. Although it is just assume the position of the phase transformation and cannot simulate the random evolution of phase transition, but it skip the inclusion problem (the beginning point of phase transition) and it will not consume much memory of computer.
5. Firstly, it use the free energy function and dissipation function to build up the structure of the model also states the criterion of the equilibrium situation. Then, consider the relationship between the dissipation terms and bulk energy, twin interfacial energy, phase interfacial energy and the grain boundary energy. After getting every together, it also analyze the sudden jump of the phase transformation. The detail things are in the Part II of the theory.
6. Different author will have different assumptions, for this paper, it begins with thermodynamic criterion for stability and equilibrium. Here, it briefly determine the interfacial energy part due to elastic micro-strains in a vicinity of a micro-structured interface.
