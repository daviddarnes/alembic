An introduction Latex
------------

There are many famous wars in this world, Microsoft Word vs Latex is one in it. Actually, if one want to change the article editing tool from Microsoft Word to Latex, it will be a difficult thing because these two tools are totally different. Microsoft Word is a GUI to edit the files you need and you have to click many buttons to change the outline of your files. But Latex is like coding, if you want to have an equation, enlarge the words or change the color, all are needed to code. But there is one benefit if you choose Latex, you will not worry about the typesetting of your file too much. To be honestly, these two typesetting tools are for different targets. 

>Microsoft Word: It is invented by Microsoft company. In the beginning, the user can only type some words in it. And because a lot of users want to use more complicated functions, so Microsoft company adds many functions in it and makes Microsoft Word a big and useful tool now.
