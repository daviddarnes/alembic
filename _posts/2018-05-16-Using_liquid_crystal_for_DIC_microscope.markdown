A review after reading this paper
------------

This is the paper which is similar to the DIC set up which is built by myself. And there are several important points I should notice and focus on:

(1) The optical section depth is thinner if a Nomarski prism with smaller shear amount is used. It means that the smaller shear distance, the thinner focus depth. There is another paper mentioned it and discussed it in the reference[1]. 

(2) Because traditional DIC microscope can just detect one-dimensional height gradient (slope in one direction), so it is impossible to reconstruct the 3D surface of the material or cell. In the old time, people use mechanical rotation either of the specimen or DIC prism, but it will introduce some misalignment and it is not a good way to detect the topography of sample. And this paper use liquid crystal as the half wave plate to rotate the shear direction of the beam. So without rotating the sample, we can detect the slope in 2 directions. And this paper also gives some mechanical rotation papers.

(3) This paper points out some important informations about the Nomarski prism. The large prism displacement causes a strong non-uniformity of intensity distribution of the view filed and reduce image contrast. And this paper use special displacement compensator to compensate this phenomena. Each of the prism introduce own bias, which is not uniform and has a bias gradient. I think it may introduce the bias gradient on the final picture.

(4) This paper measured two things, one is the shear angle of the prism and another is measuring the bias introduced by prism, liquid crystal and other components. For the shear angle, they take out the prism and measure it in another set up. They use the bias to measure the shear angle. But for bias, they just put everything into the system and measure the whole bias. It also mentions that the bias measurement cannot distinguish a certain bias value but because the intensity function is a periodic function so it does not matter if the bias is Pi or 2Pi.

(5) It measures some Olympus's prism and give its shear angle and shear distance in a table.
