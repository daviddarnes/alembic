A review after reading this paper
------------

This paper presents two important opinions I should notice:

(1) The optical sectioning of a conventional DIC microscope is small but they can use the microscope sectioning technic to enlarge the detect range. Also, the contrast is very sensitive to the shear distance. The smaller the shear amount becomes, the lower the contrast will be achieved. The contrast is proportional to the shear amount. The paper also points out that smaller shear will introduce lower focus depth.

(2) For the sectioning part, it has a mask to judge whether the whole things are in focus. And the intensity will be the judgement for the mask.

In this paper, although it has modulated bias components, it just detect the sample in 1 direction so it is still a one dimensional project. So， it does not give some reconstruction sample. But it gives a lot of interesting papers for reference. Also, it use Fourier optics to explain the reconstruction process and the intensity's relationship.
