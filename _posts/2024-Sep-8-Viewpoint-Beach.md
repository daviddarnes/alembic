Dearest Isay,

Today, we hiked and camped at Viewpoint Beach, Golden Ears Park. I carried about 30lbs of gear, while Daddy carried you and the food. Daddy's pack was definitely heavier than mine. 

We have been to the park many times and at one point saw people carrying backpacks with kids. From then, I had a mental note that Golden Ears as is a kid friendly backpacking destination. I just was not sure about the details.

Last weekend, Daddy and I decided to finally go to Viewpoint Beach. There are other options in Golden Ears such as Halfmoon Beach (easy, 10km from the parking lot), Alder Flats (moderate, 10km from the parking lot), and Golden Ears Summit (hard, 10km from the parking lot). We opted to do the easiest option since it is our first time with the three of us. The hike was relatively flat and easy. We were the 3rd group to set-up our tent so we had plenty of options to set-up our camp in. We opted to go in the forest, instead of by the river. 

In the beach, you played with the rocks by the river: making a fake chair made of rocks, throwing rocks and looking for the pretiest rock. We had hot chocolate and dinner by the river. You insited on walking around the campsite by yourself. There wer a lot of dogs and other kids and you said "Hi" to them. A lot. Mommy and Daddy enjoyed watching you play, and being surrounded by the river and the surrounding mountains. 

We set up our tent and went to sleep. You started to have runny nose and was not feeling well. You woke up every hour crying. At one point, you woke up, sat down, and started passing out while sitting. I held your head while you slept sitting down. Around 6am, you got woken up by the sound of birds - the best alarm clock! One flew right above our tent; We could hear its strong wings flapping above us. It said "Plock, Plock." You immediately sat up and opened your eyes really wide, unsure of what to do. Then we laughed at it because it's just a bird and there is nothing to be scared of.

Overall, the campsite was great. It was easy to hike in, there were plenty of sites available, it was easy to get a reservation, there were facilities available, there was a perfect amount of poeple - not too many that it was crowded and not too little that I was scared of wildlife, and the view of the river and mountains were beautiful.
