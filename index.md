**A theme designed to be a starting point for any Jekyll website ⚗**

Alembic is partly a passion project, partly an effort to bundle everything I tend to build when creating a site. The plan is to make this easily forkable and setup with your system of choice. For me that will be [Siteleaf](http://www.siteleaf.com/), so some of the configuration has been created with that platform in mind.
