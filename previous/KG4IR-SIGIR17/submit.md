Review Criteria
---------------
Contributions will be evaluated according to criteria of novelty, soundness, and potential:
1. Novelty: Is this something the community may not know and worth knowing?
2. Soundness: Is it supported by evidence or convincinglly argued?
3. Potential: Is this worth knowing and disseminating?

Preference will be given to papers that describe research in an ongoing stage with the highest potential for turning into a full paper next year.
