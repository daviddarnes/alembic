- single-blind or double-blind
- formatted in CEUR-WS compatible format (http://kg4ir.github.io/template/)
- and submitted as PDF through the EasyChair Conference Submission
System (please select research paper category): https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=kg4ir0


(2) Talk abstracts about future trends, tasks, and open problems, as well as talk abstracts about papers simultaneously submitted to the KG4IR Special Issue KG4IR at the Information Retrieval Journal.

Talk abstracts have to be:
- limited to 1 page including citations
- single-blind
- indicate dual submission to the KG4IR Special Issue
- formatted in [CEUR-WS compatible format](/template/onecolceurws.sty)
- and submitted as PDF through the [EasyChair Conference Submission](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=kg4ir0) System (please select talk abstract category).


Contingent on consent of the authors, all accepted papers and talk abstracts will be included in proceedings through CEUR-WS.org for open-access online publication and distribution before the workshop day. The copyright will remain with the authors.

Upon acceptance, at least one author of each accepted paper must register for the Workshop.

Review Criteria
---------------
Contributions will be evaluated according to criteria of novelty, utility, and soundness:

1. Novelty: Is this something the community does not already know?
2. Utility: Is this something worth knowing and disseminating?
3. Soundness: Is it believably true or at least convincingly argued?

For research papers, preference will be given to papers in an ongoing state with the highest potential for turning into a full conference paper next year.

For talk abstracts, preference will be given to forward-looking discussions on new trends, future applications and tasks, and so far overlooked open problems.


Dual Submission to the KG4IR Special Issue at the Information Retrieval Journal
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Authors planning a submission to the KG4IR Special Issue in the Information Retrieval Journal, we offer the opportunity to simultaneously submit a talk abstract to the KG4IR workshop. In this case, please indicate the paper title of the journal submission when submitting the talk abstract.
