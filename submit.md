Review Criteria
---------------
Contributions will be evaluated according to criteria of novelty, soundness, and potential:
1. Novelty: Is this something the community may not know and worth knowing?
2. Soundness: Is it believably true or at least convincingly argued?
3. Potential: Is this worth working on and can it be turned into a nice paper in the future?
